										<h1>Events</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>One of the goals of any Space Science club is to involve more people in their activities and enable them to enjoy and learn more about Space Science. And, events are the best way to do that. Stellaria conducts many events including but not limited to workshops, contests, talks and lectures. Most of these events are conducted with the goal of reaching towards the general public and helping them understand more about the unimaginable things that happen away from and on our planet.</p>
									<p><ul><li><b>Online Stargazing Workshop:</b><br>The “Online Stargazing Workshop”  was conducted on 16th February 2021, with the goal of introducing the participants to Stargazing with the help of a free software called Stellarium. We had students from all departments of SASTRA turn up for the workshop, eager about learning to identify these gems of the night. It was a fun and fruitful session with everyone learning a bit from everyone else and leaving with a little more knowledge of the night sky.</li><li><b>Stellaria Space Week 2020:</b><br>“World Space Week”, a time for  the celebration of the wonders of Space Science and a time of  celebration for all lovers of Space Science. World Space Week 2020 at Stellaria was a wonderful time of people virtually coming together to celebrate one of the things the love, the night sky. <br>For Space Week 2020, Stellaria conducted three events “Kerbal Space Program”, “Wor(l)ds Weaver”  and “Constellation Hunt”. We also had two talks, one on “Space Entrepreneurship”  by Nithish Kumar – CEO of Alinea and host of UNBOUNDED podcast, and another by Stellaria alumunus R.Kaustubh on “Project Moonwatch”.</li></ul>

										<h1>Outreach</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The goal of the Outreach Cluster is to connect with people interested in Space Science outside of SASTRA, bring to them oppurtunities to learn more and share what they know about Space Science and everything related to it.</p>
									<p><b>Annular Solar Eclipse 2k19:</b><br>For the Annular Solar Eclipse that occurred on the 26th of December 2019, Stellaria gave the locals of Sengipatti (a village about 7km from SASTRA) a closer look at the “Ring of Fire”. Locals of all ages from the village and even a few passersby took a peek at the eclipse through our Dobsonian mount light bucket telescope. A small step to bridge the gap between us humans and the skies a little bit more.
</p>
									<p><b>INSPIRE Camp:</b><br>Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Reasearch, INSPIRE is a program sponsored by the Department of Science and Technology. It’s main goal is to communicate to youth the excitements of creative pursuit of science. Stellaria has been religiously taking part in INSPIRE Camps, reaching out to young minds and making them aware about the wonders of Space Science.<br>INSPIRE Camp 2k18:<br>Members of Stellaria, Naimish and Shrivathsan, gave a talk about Space Travel to all the students who were present on SASTRA for the INSPIRE Camp. Their talk enriched the participants knowledge of Space Travel Missions and Deep Space Exploration. It was an elightening experience for both the participants and the hosts.
</p>
                                    <p><b>RSIC Camp:</b><br>As part of the Research Science Initiative at IIT Chennai (RSIC), conducted jointly by SASTRA, IIT Madras and PSBB group of schools, students visited in SASTRA and participated in various activities. This program was mainly to impress the young students and impart the essential concepts in Science and Engineering. Stellaria also participated in the students’ visit to SASTRA and helped the students gain an insight on astronomy and Space Science.</p>
